# AppStorePkg

In contrast to [Nick McSpadden's solution](https://github.com/autopkg/nmcspadden-recipes/tree/master/AppStoreApp) to autopkg & Mac App Store apps this solution tries to work with as-distributed .pkg installers from Apple's Mac App Store. To get these installer pkgs one can follow [Rich Trouton's instructions](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/10/19/downloading-microsofts-remote-desktop-installer-package-from-the-app-store/) or use a script such as [AppStoreExtract](https://github.com/maxschlapfer/MacAdminHelpers/tree/master/AppStoreExtract). Then create a child recipe of AppStorePkg, define `NAME`, `APP_NAME`, and `MUNKI_REPO_SUBDIR` variables and it should spit out a Munki package & pkginfo suitable for use. Remember to provide autopkg with the seperately-downloaded package (name with "-p" switch) when running.
